<h1>Relations</h1>
<h2>What is a relation?</h2>
<p1>A relation is how the elements in the domain relate to the elements in the codomain.</p1>
<br>
<p2><b>Domain</b> of the relation - the "subject" of the relation.</p2>
<br>
<p3><b>Co-domain</b> of the relation - the "object" of the relation.</p3>
<br>
<br>
<p4 style="font-size:160%">Elements of the Relation</p4>
<br>
<p5>Suppose the domain is {Matt, Ethan, Jed} and the co-domain is {Cat, Dog, Lion}
<br>
The ordered pairs of the domain and co-domain are (Matt, Cat) , (Ethan, Dog) , and (Jed, Lion)
<br>
We call these the <b>elements</b> of the relation.</p5>
